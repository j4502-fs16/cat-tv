His credits include working with Space Station Media, MTV, HBO, CBS Sports, Nickelodeon, Google/YouTube, The Flaming Lips, The Polyphonic Spree, Kentucky Finance, Movies of Music and creating the show open music for the 2009 revival of MTV Unplugged.

            <div class="stafftitle"><p>Jennifer Erickson | Executive Director | jennifer@columbiaaccess.tv</p></div>
            <p> Jennifer Erickson joined CAT's staff in August 2010. For the seven years prior, she worked as development officer for Investigative Reporters and Editors, a non-profit training organization for journalists housed at the Missouri School of Journalism. In that role, she coordinated IRE's fundraising efforts, including IRE's $5 million endowment drive, and assisted with program development for IRE's training seminars and conferences.</p>
            <p>Jennifer is a graduate of Penn State University and has attended and presented at multiple workshops, seminars and conferences on best practices in fundraising and development.

In her free time, Jennifer volunteers for film festivals -- she’s on the core staff of Columbia’s own True/False Film Fest, helps coordinate the annual Citizen Jane Film Fest and even left town for a bit recently to help out with the Telluride Film Festival. Other favorite activities include taking on occasional producer roles for local film shoots, playing tennis and watching/thinking up ideas for movies.  </p>

          <div class="stafftitle"><p>Justin Gregory | Membership Coordinator | justin@columbiaaccess.tv</p></div>
         <p>After being a member of CAT for the last three years, Justin joined the CAT staff in October of 2011 as the Access Technician.  While volunteering at CAT he learned about the art of filmmaking as well as the technical aspects of creating television.  Before becoming employed at CAT Justin also worked on the CAT Freelance Team helping with various CAT produced projects.  He has made several shorts and some award winning PSAs, been a “Gimme Truth” finalist  and has produced programming for CAT.  Some of his most memorable and rewarding shoots at CAT would be filming professional skateboarder Tony Hawk at Cosmo Skate Park and working on the show Notes From Underground.

Justin will be taking care of field equipment check out, equipment maintenance, assisting in teaching classes and working with both CAT staff and CAT members creating programming.  Outside of CAT Justin enjoys music, watching and creating films, painting, playing disc golf, spending time outdoors and riding/working on vintage mopeds.  His interest in the community has led to volunteering for the True/False Film Festival, Clean Up Columbia, Friends of the Library, KOPN and helping to form a local moped enthusiasts club.  Justin looks forward to working with CAT members and staff as well as helping CAT grow in the future.</p>
